I) Real Time search -

1) There should be a list of items
2) Search box to type the item you want to search
3) Add an button with a text box which will allow to to update the list items present for search purpose.

No need to connect to database or make any API calls for now.

II) Create a simple To-Do list component where the user can add a list of to-do items. 
The user can click on the checkbox against the to-do item once it is completed and strike-off the completed item on the list.
